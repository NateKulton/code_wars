squaredNumber.js Notes:

I never took notes for the first one.


lostAndNoMap.js Notes:

So in this one I am given an array and I need to double the numbers in it.
I decided to not use map so I could practice using the fundamental parts of programming.


MovingZerosToTheEnd.js Notes:

Write some code that takes an array and moves all the zeros to the end of the array
This one was actully too easy so I didn't end up writing much about it.


stringEndsWith.js Notes:

I need to make a function that returns true if the first string argument passed to it ends with the second argument.
So I ended up making two functions to do this, one that used the endsWith method, and another that using
substring and the length of both strings to tell the substring where to cut the og string to make the new one
that I compared and returned a boolean.


binaryAddition.js:

So I learned from this that I need to look back at my notes and pseudocode if I am confused to why something isn't
working right
I also learnd that usinsg .toString(2) gives you the binary of a number becasue it makes it a base of 2 in that case.
They talk about it kinda in the docs if you remember that binary is base 2 then you will see that you can tell it the
base of the radix (it can a any number between 2 and 36 (including those numbers of course)).


betterThanAverage.js:

We are given an array that we need to add up all the number and compare it to our test score and it needs to return
true of false if we are better than the average person in the class
I think there is a method to recude the array to one number, but if I can't find it I'll just loop through it and
then add all the numbers together. So I ended up just using the reduce method because I need more practice with it
